      =====================================================================================================
      Config file ".\scully.nagp-angular-assignment.config.ts" not found, only rendering routes without parameters
      The config file should have a name that is formated as:
          scully.<projectName>.config.ts
      where <projectName> is the name of the project as defined in the 'angular.json' file
      If you meant to build a different project as undefined you can use:
          --project differentProjectName as a cmd line option

      When you are in a mixed mono-repo you might need to use the --pjFirst flag.
       which will look for package.json instead of angular.json to find the 'root' of the project.
